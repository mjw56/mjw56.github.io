			<p>I've had this post half written, sitting in my queue for about 6 months now. I wanted to take some time to complete it, because maybe, it might help someone else out there.</p>

<p>Lately I've been doing a lot of thinking about what it means to be a software engineer, and the amount of time and dedication it takes to hone the skills required for our profession. I wanted to jot down some notes that have been swirling around in my head lately about this topic. My hope is that maybe someone else can relate and maybe it might help someone else who might be starting out and/or someone else who may be in a similar position. In any event, it is helping me to work through some things right now :)</p>

<h2 id="dontquitbeforethemiraclehappens">Don't quit before the miracle happens</h2>

<p>Early on in my career I remember the amount of times I was so overwhelmed with the amount of things I needed to know in order to get a small project up and running. I would spend countless hours late into the night with a broken build, scouring the internet for answers with some cryptic error message. It was fun, but at times it was downright stressful. I didn't give up though, and would eventually get it working. It was a good feeling, and something I wanted to experience again. So I kept up with it.</p>

<p>One thing in particular that I found was that there are a lot of starter kits and projects out there encouraged to get people going with a new tech quickly. While I don't believe that the people who make these have bad intentions (I myself have made a few of these), I do think that they can be confusing to people who might be new to the tech. My advice here would be to find something you are interested in, and focus solely on that piece of tech. What I mean by this is, don't necessarily run to install a yeoman scaffold if you want to learn react or angular2. Maybe just do the bare minimum setup possible when starting. Then, when required, go and bring in another dependency <em>if absolutely required</em>. </p>

<p>Why do I say this? I think when you try to learn something where a lot of the pieces have been put together for you, you tend to think that there is a lot of magic involved where really there isn't. You just need to take the time to understand how each piece connects to the other. Often, you'll get a scaffold up and running, then break something, and have absolutely no idea how to fix it because you don't understand the underlying pieces. Now, one might argue that this is the essence of programming. While I would agree it is true that we must be trained to understand how to be patient enough to disect problems and find underlying bugs, I don't know if the scaffolding route is always the best choice when starting with a brand new technology.</p>

<p>Another thing is that it seems rare to find two developers today who agree on the exact same setup for a given technology. I do think that react has  gotten this correct with their huge adoption of webpack. This made working with react projects very simple and easy, and a majority of the react community agrees around using webpack for their builds. This is a big plus for me, and one of the reasons why I love the react community. However, you need to find what works for you. I think there are a lot of brilliant developers out there giving good advice and suggestions for how to build projects, but what works for them might not necessarily work for you. The opposite is true as well. You need to take the time to gather all the information, try things out for yourself, and make the best decision possible. We're human beings, and a lot the times we're simply going with the best information we have at the time. </p>

<h2 id="softwareandjavascriptframeworkswillalwayschangewithtimetheunderlyingprinciplesarewhatmatters">Software and JavaScript frameworks will always change with time. The underlying principles are what matters.</h2>

<p>With time, perserverance, and a little bit of luck, things do get easier. I believe that once you master one JavaScript framework, you've made it much easier for yourself to learn the next one. Remember that they are all trying to achieve roughly the same goal(s): How to build the best web/mobile/native applications today. They each have their own level of abstractions on top of the underlying rendering target (DOM, native mobile platform, etc.). They're all using core JavaScript at the heart, and if you take the time learn JavaScript you've given yourself a much better chance when you find a bug or something breaks. Learn JavaScript!! Read more code than you write (this can be hard but it is worth it). I've found the React and lodash source code to be wonderful pieces of JavaScript from which to learn how to write beautiful modularized code.</p>

<h2 id="goslowtogofast">Go slow to go fast</h2>

<p>Sometimes it feels like you need to get everything done at once. While it is a lofty goal, the reality is that it's usually always near impossible to do this. It's ok to take the time to step back and re-evaluate the little things you might have missed along the way. With time, once you pickup the fundamental pieces, moving forward and learning the next thing will become that much easier. You'll be able to go faster because you've taken the time to understand the basics.</p>

<h2 id="itsoktonothavealltheanswers">It's OK to not have all the answers</h2>

<p>Asking questions can be one the scariest things to do in our profession. Often times we train ourselves to think that we must know everything and that if we show we don't know something, we are showing that we are weak. I've come to realize that the opposite is true. I think that asking questions is one of the most important things to do in this field. I've found if I'm stumped on something and I ask the question, usually the answer will come before I even finish the sentence. At the same time, always try to teach what you've learned. Give a talk, write a blog post, talk to a co-worker. Often time you'll find that when you try to explain something, you may find out you quite don't understand it as well as you thought you did. This is a great exercise to re-inforce knowledge and make yourself a great programmer!</p>

<p>I hope this helps :)</p>

<p>Cheers</p>
