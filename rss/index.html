<p>Recently I tried my hand at publishing a package to npm that was written in TypeScript. TypeScript is a nice way to write JavaScript because it has a type system which gives you instant feedback as you write your code and at compile time.  It's always nice to have that instant feedback as there are usually less surprises when you go to run your code in the browser. Another nice benefit is that you can start writing ES6-like code today! :D</p>

<p>My module is fairly simply as it is only one class with an external interface I use to define my query object. The module can be found <a href="https://github.com/mjw56/surfsup">here</a>. I am using <a href="http://gulpjs.com/">gulp</a> to automate my build process. I used <a href="https://www.npmjs.org/package/gulp-tsc">gulp-tsc</a> to compile the TypeScript in my gulp compile task. It is very straightforward and did the job well for this simple scenario. The only gotcha I ran into was how was my TypeScript going to compile itself before being sent off to the npm registry? The answer is in the <a href="https://www.npmjs.org/doc/misc/npm-scripts.html">scripts</a> property of the package.json. Inside of there we can do all sorts of awesome magic that will make sure our code is in the right state when a user wants to use our module in their code. Specifically for this use-case I used the prepublish property to run my gulp task to compile my TypeScript:</p>

<pre><code class="prettyprint javascript ">'scripts': {  
    'prepublish': 'gulp compile'
}
</code></pre>

<p>Now you're guaranteed that you'll be sending off valid JavaScript to the npm registry. Enjoy!</p>]]></description><link>http://localhost:2368/publishing-a-typescript-package-to-npm/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">390b8f0a-deae-492d-8f05-77d7136aea4c</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Mike Wilcox]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Sun, 16 Nov 2014 02:14:05 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
