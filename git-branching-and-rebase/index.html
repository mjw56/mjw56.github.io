			<p>One of the earliest philosophies I learned when using git was to "commit early and often". A lot of times when I am working on building a feature from scratch, I will make a lot of commits as I am adding new pieces. The nice part about this is the ability to quickly rollback in case something that was added didn't work out as planned. However, once a feature is complete, it might lead to a messy git history with a lot of commits that don't make a lot of sense to the person reviewing the changes.</p>

<p>Luckily git has a tool called <a href="https://git-scm.com/docs/git-rebase">rebase</a>. This tool can be used to "squash" multiple commits into one. You can do this multiple times if necessary and group commits into a single commit that is more descriptive of the high level change which was made.</p>

<p>Here is a basic strategy I like for working on a git repo:</p>

<p>1) Fork the repository that I want to work on to my personal git.</p>

<p>2) clone this repo to my local hard drive to work on.</p>

<pre><code class="bash">$ git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-FORKED-REPOSITORY
</code></pre>

<p>3) Create a new branch to work on a new feature so as not to disturb master</p>

<pre><code class="bash">$ git checkout -b my-new-feature
Switched to a new branch 'my-new-feature'  
</code></pre>

<p>4) Build out new feature, fix a bug, update documentation etc.</p>

<p>Once you have completed making your changes, if you feel you have a lot of commits which you would like to converge into one, you can follow the following steps:</p>

<pre><code>$ git rebase -i master
</code></pre>

<p>What this asking git to do is provide the list of commits which are new since checking out the branch from <code>master</code>.</p>

<p><strong>Note</strong>: By default, git will open an interactive guide in the console. This might require that you are familiar with <code>vim</code> to do any editing. If you're more comfortable editing in a text editor, you can tell git to open any command prompts in the editor of you choice. Check out the official documentation to that <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/associating-text-editors-with-git/">here</a>.</p>

<p>After running the command above, you'll get a screen which looks like this:</p>

<pre><code class="bash">pick 21fd26d add search component  
pick 717a3a0 add list component  
pick 40bedc2 fix spelling  
pick eeb6338 fix lint  
pick 1b2d1f3 add tests

# Rebase e99f870..1b2d1f3 onto e99f870 (5 command(s))
#
# Commands:
# p, pick = use commit
# r, reword = use commit, but edit the commit message
# e, edit = use commit, but stop for amending
# s, squash = use commit, but meld into previous commit
# f, fixup = like "squash", but discard this commit's log message
# x, exec = run command (the rest of the line) using shell
#
# These lines can be re-ordered; they are executed from top to bottom.
#
# If you remove a line here THAT COMMIT WILL BE LOST.
#
# However, if you remove everything, the rebase will be aborted.
#
# Note that empty commits are commented out
</code></pre>

<p>Here you can see that I have made five commits since I checked out <code>my-new-feature</code> branch. What I want to do is merge these five commits into once commit so that it is clean and gives one description of exactly what was done.</p>

<p>As you can see above, git tells us that we can use the squash command to use the commit, but meld it into the previous commit. You'll also notice that the commits are in ascending order, so the first commit which was made is at the top.</p>

<p>So we can squash all commits but the first one. You'll have to manually change the <code>pick</code> to <code>squash</code> or <code>s</code> for short. We could also use <code>fixup</code> or <code>f</code> which acts like <code>squash</code> but it removes the whole commit message. I want to keep the original commit message, so I will stick to <code>s</code> for now. Let's make the change:</p>

<pre><code class="bash">pick 21fd26d add search component  
s 717a3a0 add list component  
s 40bedc2 fix spelling  
s eeb6338 fix lint  
s 1b2d1f3 add tests  
</code></pre>

<p>If you want to update the final commit message, don't worry, we'll be able to do that shortly. One other nice thing we can do is re-order the commits. So, if your list if very big, and you want to group similar commits into a single commit, you can re-order and squash them as necessary.</p>

<p>Save your changes and close the interactive screen. You should be prompted with another screen asking you to confirm your changes:</p>

<pre><code class="bash"># This is a combination of 5 commits.
# The first commit's message is:
add search component

# This is the 2nd commit message:

add list component

# This is the 3rd commit message:

fix spelling

# This is the 4th commit message:

fix lint

# This is the 5th commit message:

add tests

# Please enter the commit message for your changes. Lines starting
# with '#' will be ignored, and an empty message aborts the commit.
#
# Date:      Sun Mar 20 14:04:52 2016 -0400
#
# rebase in progress; onto e99f870
# You are currently editing a commit while rebasing branch 'my-new-feature' on 'e99f870'.
#
# Changes to be committed:
#    new file:   list-component.js
#    new file:   search-component.js
#    new file:   tests.js
#
</code></pre>

<p>Here is your opportunity to edit any commit messages you would like. I am going to edit the first commit message to give a more descriptive message of what all was done.</p>

<pre><code class="bash"># This is a combination of 5 commits.
# The first commit's message is:
Add Search and List components. Add tests for Search and List.  
</code></pre>

<p>Now I am done, I save this change and exit the interactive session:</p>

<pre><code class="bash"> $ git rebase -i master                                       [14:05:55]
[detached HEAD 5fdad05] Add Search and List components. Add tests for Search and List.
 Date: Sun Mar 20 14:04:52 2016 -0400
 3 files changed, 2 insertions(+)
 create mode 100644 list-component.js
 create mode 100644 search-component.js
 create mode 100644 tests.js
Successfully rebased and updated refs/heads/my-new-feature.  
</code></pre>

<p>Success! We've successfully merged multiple commits into one commit now. </p>

<p>The next step is to push these local changes to the remote server. If you have not pushed any of these changes yet, a simple <code>git push origin my-new-feature</code> should suffice. However, if you have been pushing your changes over a period of time, you'll need to force push to erase the history and only show the new commits. <strong>WARNING!!!</strong> forcing a push can be very dangerous and can lead to overwriting history in the repository. You should only do this if you are working in a local branch which does not contain work that has been shared with other contributors. If you do force a push with commits that other contributors have been working on, you risk erasing their work or getting their branch out of sync. You've been warned! :)</p>

<p>So now you can see that it's possible to clean up a messy commit history and provide nice, clean, descriptive messages. If you've never done this before, I encourage you to first try this out locally on a test repository by adding files and a bunch of commit messages. Then run the <code>rebase</code> command. If you're interested in learning about more in-depth features, check out <a href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Rewriting-History">Rewriting History</a> on the git documentation site.</p>
